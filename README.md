## RTK Query

[LIVE Demo app](https://rtk-query-mini-project.vercel.app/)

This project is a simple example of how to use RTK Query to fetch data from an API and display it in a React application.

I have used this FREE API [Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to perform my CRUD operations.

Though this is a simple example, it is a good starting point to understand how RTK Query works.
I have created the API for all the 4 CRUD operations.
But I have used only the GET & POST API in this example. (Because I am lazy to create the UI for PUT & DELETE ðŸ˜… and also they works the same way as POST.  )
